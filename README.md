# TEAM NO.145-AuthShield: A Full Stack Authentication System using Spring Boot, React, Email OTP, and JWT for Secure Web Application Access
## About

AuthShield is a full stack authentication and authorization system designed to provide secure, scalable, and reliable user access control for modern web applications.
The system uses Spring Boot for backend services, React for frontend user interaction, Email-based OTP verification for identity validation, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
AuthShield ensures that only verified users can access protected resources while maintaining high security standards and a smooth user experience.

## Features

🔐 Secure user registration and login

📧 Email-based OTP verification

🪪 JWT-based authentication and authorization

🔄 Stateless session management

👤 Role-based access control (Admin / User)

⚛️ Modern and responsive React UI

🛡️ Password encryption using BCrypt

🌐 RESTful API architecture

## Development Requirements
### Backend

Java 17+

Spring Boot

Spring Security

JWT

Hibernate / JPA

MySQL / PostgreSQL

### Frontend

React.js

Axios

React Router

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Tools
Maven

Node.js & npm

Postman

IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code

## System Architecture
### Architecture Overview:

### 1. React Frontend:
Handles user interaction

Sends authentication requests to backend

### Spring Boot Backend:
Manages authentication logic

Generates and validates JWT tokens

Handles OTP verification and email service

### Database
Stores user credentials and roles securely

### Email Service
Sends OTP for verification during registration and login

## 📌 Authentication Flow:
```
User → React UI → Spring Boot API → OTP Verification → JWT Generation → Secure Access
```
## Methodology
### 1. User Registration & OTP Verification

i) User registers using email and password.

ii) Password is encrypted using BCrypt.

iii) An OTP is generated and sent to the user’s email.

iv) Account is activated only after successful OTP verification.

### 2. Authentication & JWT Generation

i) User logs in with valid credentials.

ii) Spring Security authenticates the user.

iii) A JWT token is generated upon successful login.

iv) JWT is sent to the client and stored securely.

### 3. Authorization & Secure API Access

i) Each request includes the JWT token in the header.

ii) Backend validates the token.

iii) Access is granted based on user role and permissions.

iv) Unauthorized access is blocked automatically.

## Setup Instructions
### Backend (Spring Boot)
```
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
### Frontend (React)
```
npm install
npm start
```
### Access Application
```
http://localhost:3000   (Frontend)
http://localhost:8080   (Backend API)
```
## Key Implementation Code
### JWT Utility (Spring Boot)
```
public String generateToken(UserDetails userDetails) {
    return Jwts.builder()
            .setSubject(userDetails.getUsername())
            .setIssuedAt(new Date())
            .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000))
            .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, secretKey)
            .compact();
}
```
### OTP Generation
```
public String generateOtp() {
    return String.valueOf(new Random().nextInt(900000) + 100000);
}
```
### Secure Password Encoding
```
@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}
```
## Results

✔️ Secure authentication using JWT

✔️ Successful email OTP verification

✔️ Stateless and scalable backend architecture

✔️ Smooth frontend-backend integration

✔️ Improved application security and user trust

AuthShield provides a robust authentication framework suitable for enterprise-level web applications.

## Future Enhancements
🔹 Add multi-factor authentication (MFA)

🔹 Integrate OAuth (Google, GitHub login)

🔹 Implement refresh tokens

🔹 Deploy using Docker & cloud platforms

🔹 Add audit logs for login activities
